# What is Svelte-Anywhere?

**Svelte-Anywhere** is a Vite plugin that unlocks the full potential of Svelte components, allowing you to use them **anywhere HTML is accepted**. Whether you're working on a modern web app, a legacy project, or even a CMS platform, Svelte-Anywhere makes it effortless to embed Svelte components into any environmentâ€”no rewrites.

## Why Svelte-Anywhere?

Svelte-Anywhere bridges the gap between Svelte's modern development experience and the real-world needs of web projects. Here's what makes it stand out:

- **Universal Compatibility**: Use Svelte components in vanilla JavaScript, server-rendered HTML, CMS platforms, or even legacy projects.
- **Custom Elements Made Simple**: Turn Svelte components into reusable custom elements with just a single annotation.
- **Dynamic & Scalable**: Enjoy hot module reloading during development and lazy loading for production.
- **Shadow DOM Control**: Choose between open or no shadow DOM for full encapsulation control.
- **Modernize Without Rewriting**: Bring Svelte to existing projects without starting from scratch.
