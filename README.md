# Vite Plugin Svelte Anywhere
Use Svelte components anywhere.

This Vite plugin empowers developers to define reusable custom elements directly within their Svelte components. 

Once set up, simply annotate your component with a custom tag, and it’s ready to be embedded anywhere HTML is accepted—no additional steps required.
