# Vite Plugin Svelte Anywhere
Easily use Svelte components outside a Svelte context! 

This Vite plugin empowers developers to define reusable custom elements directly within their Svelte components. 

Once set up, simply annotate your component with a custom tag, and it’s ready to be embedded anywhere HTML is accepted—no additional steps required.
